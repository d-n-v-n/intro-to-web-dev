    <h1>🌎 Hello World</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the page for the Week One assignment for <br>
      Kevin Workman's Intro to Web Development course.
    </p>

    <p>The goals of this week's assignment are relatively simple,<br>
    and I understand the purpose of not getting <em>too</em> carried away.<br>
    This week I am to use five "new-to-me" HTML tags.</p>

    <p>My name is <b>Donovan C. Archer</b>.<br>
      I am an <b>InFoRmAtToN sErViCeS tEcHnIcIaN</b><br>
      In 2018, I graduated with a BS in <br>
      <b>Computers & Information Technology</b> from <br>
      <b>Purdue University</b>.
    </p>

    <p>I engage with others on the web through my <a href="https://twitter.com/dcarcher">Twitter🐦</a><br>
    where I talk about art, technology, and the random<br>
    happenings in my personal life.
    </p>

    


    <p>
    That being said, the original purpose of me<br>
    learning web development was to supplement/replace<br>
    the use of my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/donovan.archer/">Instagram📷</a> as a <br>
   platform for my <b>live music photography.</b>
