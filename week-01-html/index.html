    <p>Welcome to the page for the Week One assignment for <br>
      Kevin Workman's Intro to Web Development course.
    </p>

    <p>
    The goals of this week's assignment are relatively simple,<br>
    and I understand the purpose of not getting <em>too</em> carried away.<br>
    This week I am to use five "new-to-me" HTML tags.<br><hr>

  <h2>My name is Donovan C. Archer.</h2>

    <p>
      I am a lover of art, music, and technology. <br>
      I am an <b>InFoRmAtToN sErViCeS tEcHnIcIaN</b><br>
      and <b>2018 Purdue University CNIT Graduate.</b>
    </p>

    <p>In addition to my day job, I frequently <br>
    engage with others on the web through my Twitter, <br>
    where I talk about art, technology, and the random<br>
    happenings in my personal life.
    </p>

    <p>
    While my professional role is fairly technical,<br>
    it has involved very little programming.<br>
    This course is a means of brushing up<br>
    (and building upon) skills I have not touched<br>
    in years, with the end-goal of building a<br>
    platform for my <b>live music photography.</b>
